This is some incomprehensive test input. All the English alphabet is in here, sort of, not all capitalizations are represented.
Like still though, where will you find better test input? Some "Hello World" file?
I mean, plenty of other really great places, but just where else does a quick brown fox ride a zebra to Valhalla?
